# Smart-Segmentation-for-Customer-Personas

## Project Description
This project focuses on applying unsupervised machine learning techniques, primarily K-Means clustering, to segment mall customer data. The goal is to identify distinct customer groups based on features like age, gender, annual income, and spending score. The project explores different combinations of features for segmentation, uses the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters, introduces Hierarchical Clustering as an alternative, and generates data-driven personas for the identified segments.

## Tech Stack
*   **Python:** The primary programming language used for the analysis and model building.
*   **pandas:** Used for data loading, manipulation, and analysis.
*   **NumPy:** Used for numerical operations and data handling.
*   **Matplotlib:** Used for creating static visualizations.
*   **Seaborn:** Used for creating informative statistical graphics based on Matplotlib.
*   **Plotly Express:** Used for creating interactive visualizations, particularly the 3D scatter plot.
*   **scipy:** Used for hierarchical clustering and dendrogram visualization.
*   **scikit-learn:** Used for data preprocessing (scaling) and K-Means clustering.
*   **Google Colab:** The environment where the notebook was developed and executed.
*   **Git:** Used to clone the dataset from a GitHub repository.

## How to Run
1.  **Open the notebook in Google Colab:** Upload or open the notebook file (`.ipynb`) in your Google Colab environment.
2.  **Install dependencies:** Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. If running in a new Colab environment, you can install them using pip (refer to the `requirements.txt` file generated earlier).
3.  **Run all cells:** Execute all the code cells in the notebook sequentially from top to bottom. This will perform the data loading, exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, clustering, visualization, and persona analysis.
